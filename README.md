# aws-eks-accelerator-for-terraform

# Main Purpose

This project provides a framework for deploying best-practice multi-tenant [EKS Clusters](https://aws.amazon.com/eks) with [Kubernetes Addons](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/), provisioned via [Hashicorp Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [Helm charts](https://helm.sh/) on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

# Overview

The AWS EKS Accelerator for Terraform module helps you to provision [EKS Clusters](https://aws.amazon.com/eks), [Managed node groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html) with [On-Demand](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-on-demand-instances.html) and [Spot Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-spot-instances.html), [AWS Fargate profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate-profile.html), and all the necessary Kubernetes add-ons for a production-ready EKS cluster.
The [Terraform Helm provider](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-helm) is used to deploy common Kubernetes Addons with publicly available [Helm Charts](https://artifacthub.io/). This module also provides the integration for number AWS services like Amazon Managed Prometheus, EMR on EKS etc.
This project leverages the community [terraform-aws-eks](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-eks) modules to EKS Cluster.

The intention of this framework is to help design config driven solution. This will help you to create EKS clusters for various environments and AWS accounts across multiple regions with a **unique Terraform configuration and state file** per EKS cluster.

# Node Group Modules

This module uses dedicated sub modules for creating [AWS Managed Node Groups](modules/aws-eks-managed-node-groups), [Self-managed Node groups](modules/aws-eks-self-managed-node-groups) and [Fargate profiles](modules/aws-eks-fargate-profiles).
These modules provide flexibility to add or remove managed/self-managed node groups/fargate profiles by simply adding/removing map of values to input config. See [example](deploy/eks-cluster-with-new-vpc/main.tf).

The `aws-auth` ConfigMap handled by this module allow your nodes to join your cluster, and you also use this ConfigMap to add RBAC access to IAM users and roles.
Each Node Group can have dedicated IAM role, Launch template and Security Group to improve the security.

Please refer this [full example](deploy/eks-cluster-with-new-vpc/main.tf)

### Kubernetes Addon Example

The following example deploys the Addons with default configuration.

```hcl
metrics_server_enable = true            # Deploys Metrics Server Addon

cluster_autoscaler_enable = true        # Deploys Cluster Autoscaler Addon

prometheus_enable = true                # Deploys Prometheus Addon

```

This module also allows you to override `values.yaml` from consumer module.

```hcl
  # Optional Map value
  metrics_server_helm_chart = {
    name           = "metrics-server"
    repository     = "https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/metrics-server/"
    chart          = "metrics-server"
    version        = "3.5.0"
    namespace      = "kube-system"
    timeout        = "1200"

    # (Optional) Example to pass metrics-server-values.yaml from your local repo
    values = [templatefile("${path.module}/k8s_addons/metrics-server-values.yaml", {
      operating_system                = "linux"
    })]
  }
```

## Bottlerocket OS

[Bottlerocket](https://aws.amazon.com/bottlerocket/) is an open source operating system specifically designed for running containers. Bottlerocket build system is based on Rust. It's a container host OS and doesn't have additional software's or package managers other than what is needed for running containers hence its very light weight and secure. Container optimized operating systems are ideal when you need to run applications in Kubernetes  with minimal setup and do not want to worry about security or updates, or want OS support from  cloud provider. Container operating systems does updates transactionally.

Bottlerocket has two containers runtimes running. Control container **on** by default used for AWS Systems manager and remote API access. Admin container **off** by default for deep debugging and exploration.

Bottlerocket [Launch templates userdata](modules/aws-eks-managed-node-groups/templates/userdata-bottlerocket.tpl) uses the TOML format with Key-value pairs.
Remote API access API via SSM agent. You can launch trouble shooting container via user data `[settings.host-containers.admin] enabled = true`.

### Features

* [Secure](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/blob/develop/SECURITY_FEATURES.md) - Opinionated, specialized and highly secured
* **Flexible** - Multi cloud and multi orchestrator
* **Transactional** -  Image based upgraded and rollbacks
* **Isolated** - Separate container Runtimes

### Updates

Bottlerocket can be updated automatically via Kubernetes  Operator

```shell script
    kubectl apply -f Bottlerocket_k8s.csv.yaml
    kubectl get ClusterServiceVersion Bottlerocket_k8s | jq.'status'
```

# How to Deploy

## Prerequisites:

Ensure that you have installed the following tools in your Mac or Windows Laptop before start working with this module and run Terraform Plan and Apply

1. [aws cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
2. [aws-iam-authenticator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-aws-iam-authenticator.html)
3. [kubectl](https://Kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
4. [terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

## Deployment Steps

The following steps walks you through the deployment of example [DEV cluster](deploy/eks-cluster-with-new-vpc/main.tf) configuration.
This config deploys a private EKS cluster with public and private subnets.
One managed node group and fargate profile for default namespace placed in private subnets. ALB placed in Public subnets created by AWS LB Ingress controller.
It also deploys few kubernetes apps i.e., AWS LB Ingress Controller, Metrics Server and Cluster Autoscaler.

#### Step1: Clone the repo

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/jvargh/eks-tf-accelerator-3.0.git
```

#### Step2: (Optional) Update example [main.tf](deploy/eks-cluster-with-new-vpc/main.tf) file

Update local variables `deploy/new_vpc/main.tf` or keep it as default
You can choose to use an existing VPC ID and Subnet IDs or create a new VPC and subnets by providing CIDR ranges.

#### Step3: Set AWS profile or Assume IAM role

This role will become the Kubernetes Admin by default. Please see this document for [assuming a role](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/iam-assume-role-cli/)

#### Step4: Run Terraform INIT

To initialize a working directory with configuration files

```shell script
cd deploy/new_vpc/
terraform init
```

#### Step5: Run Terraform PLAN

To verify the resources created by this execution

```shell script
terraform plan
```

#### Step6: Finally, Terraform APPLY

to create resources

```shell script
terraform apply
```

### Configure kubectl and test cluster

EKS Cluster details can be extracted from terraform output or from AWS Console to get the name of cluster.
This following command used to update the `kubeconfig` in your local machine where you run kubectl commands to interact with your EKS Cluster.

#### Step7: Run update-kubeconfig command.

`~/.kube/config` file gets updated with cluster details and certificate from the below command

$ aws eks --region <region> update-kubeconfig --name <cluster-name>
#### Step8: List all the worker nodes by running the command below

$ kubectl get nodes
#### Step9: List all the pods running in kube-system namespace

$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system
## Advanced Deployment Folder Structure

This example shows how to structure folders in your repo when you want to deploy multiple EKS Clusters across multiple regions and accounts.

The top-level `deploy\advanced` folder provides an example of how you can structure your folders and files to define multiple EKS Cluster environments and consume this accelerator module.
This approach is suitable for large projects, with clearly defined sub directory and file structure.
This can be modified the way that suits your requirement.
You can define a unique configuration for each EKS Cluster and making this module as central source of truth.

Each folder under `live/<region>/application` represents an EKS cluster environment(e.g., dev, test, load etc.).
This folder contains `backend.conf` and `<env>.tfvars`, used to create a unique Terraform state for each cluster environment.
Terraform backend configuration can be updated in `backend.conf` and cluster common configuration variables in `<env>.tfvars`

e.g. folder/file structure for defining multiple clusters

├── deploy\new_vpc
│      └── main.tf
│      └── outputs.tf
├── deploy\existing_vpc
│      └── main.tf
│      └── outputs.tf

## Important Note

If you are using an existing VPC then you need to ensure that the following tags added to the VPC and subnet resources

Add Tags to **VPC**

```hcl
    Key = "Kubernetes.io/cluster/${local.cluster_name}"
    Value = "Shared"
```
Add Tags to **Public Subnets tagging** requirement

```hcl
    public_subnet_tags = {
      "Kubernetes.io/cluster/${local.cluster_name}" = "shared"
      "Kubernetes.io/role/elb"                      = "1"
    }
```
Add Tags to **Private Subnets tagging** requirement

```hcl
    private_subnet_tags = {
      "Kubernetes.io/cluster/${local.cluster_name}" = "shared"
      "Kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb"             = "1"
    }
```
For **fully Private EKS clusters** requires the following VPC endpoints to be created to communicate with AWS services.

com.amazonaws.region.aps-workspaces            - For AWS Managed Prometheus Workspace
com.amazonaws.region.ssm                       - Secrets Management
com.amazonaws.region.ec2
com.amazonaws.region.ecr.api
com.amazonaws.region.ecr.dkr
com.amazonaws.region.logs                       – For CloudWatch Logs
com.amazonaws.region.sts                        – If using AWS Fargate or IAM roles for service accounts
com.amazonaws.region.elasticloadbalancing       – If using Application Load Balancers
com.amazonaws.region.autoscaling                – If using Cluster Autoscaler
com.amazonaws.region.s3                         – Creates S3 gateway
